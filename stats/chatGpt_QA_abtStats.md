### 1. what are different statistical tests that I should compulsorily know?

There are many different statistical tests that you should know, and the specific tests that you need to know will depend on your field of study and the type of research you are conducting. Some commonly used statistical tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA tests, and regression analysis. These tests are used to analyze and compare data sets, and to determine if there are significant differences between groups of data. It's important to choose the appropriate statistical test for your data and research question, and to understand how to interpret the results of the test.

### 2. what are t-tests?

T-tests are a type of statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups of data. There are two main types of t-tests: the independent samples t-test, which is used to compare the means of two groups that are unrelated to each other, and the dependent samples t-test, which is used to compare the means of two groups that are related to each other in some way.

T-tests are commonly used in psychology and education research to compare the means of two groups on a particular variable, such as the test scores of students in a control group and an experimental group. The t-test allows the researcher to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups, and to calculate the probability that the difference occurred by chance.

### 3. Explain a p-value with example

A p-value is a probability value that is used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between two groups of data. The p-value is the probability that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance, given that the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no difference between the two groups.

For example, let's say that you are conducting a study to compare the effectiveness of two different teaching methods on student test scores. You randomly assign students to either the control group, which receives the traditional teaching method, or the experimental group, which receives the new teaching method. After a period of time, you collect the test scores of all the students and use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups. The p-value of the t-test tells you the probability that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance.

If the p-value is less than 0.05, this means that there is less than a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance, and you can reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups, and that the new teaching method is likely to be more effective than the traditional method. On the other hand, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, this means that there is more than a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance, and you cannot reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is not a statistically significant difference between the two groups, and that the new teaching method is not significantly different from the traditional method.

### 4. If I have 10 years of salary information, is it possible to say the salary of a particular year is statistically different from the rest?

Yes, it is possible to determine if the salary of a particular year is statistically different from the rest of the years using a statistical test such as a t-test. To do this, you would first need to organize your data into two groups: one group containing the salary for the year in question, and the other group containing the salaries for all the other years. Then, you would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups. The t-test will calculate a p-value, which tells you the probability that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance.

If the p-value is less than 0.05, this means that there is less than a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance, and you can reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the salary for the year in question and the salaries for the other years. On the other hand, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, this means that there is more than a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups occurred by chance, and you cannot reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is not a statistically significant difference between the salary for the year in question and the salaries for the other years.

It's important to note that a statistically significant difference does not necessarily mean that the salary for the year in question is actually different from the other years. The t-test only tells you the probability that the difference occurred by chance. To determine if the salary for the year in question is actually different from the other years, you would need to look at the data and consider other factors that may have influenced the salary.

### 5. What is the difference between different statitical tests?

There are many different statistical tests, and the specific test that you choose will depend on the type of data that you have and the research question that you are trying to answer. Different statistical tests are designed to analyze different types of data and to answer different types of research questions.

For example, t-tests are used to compare the means of two groups of data, and are commonly used in psychology and education research to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand, chi-square tests are used to compare the frequencies of events in two groups of data, and are commonly used in fields such as epidemiology and sociology to determine if there is a significant association between the two groups.

Other commonly used statistical tests include ANOVA tests, which are used to compare the means of multiple groups of data, and regression analysis, which is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Each of these tests has its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and it's important to choose the appropriate test for your data and research question.

### 6. How are false discovery rate and p-value related?

The false discovery rate (FDR) is a measure of the proportion of false positives in a set of statistical tests. It is calculated as the expected proportion of false positives among all the tests that are declared to be significant, based on a specified significance level, such as 0.05.

The p-value is the probability that the observed difference between two groups of data occurred by chance, given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether or not the difference between the two groups is statistically significant.

The relationship between the false discovery rate and the p-value is that the false discovery rate can be used to control the overall probability of making a false positive error when conducting multiple statistical tests. For example, if you are conducting multiple t-tests to compare the means of two groups on different variables, you can use the false discovery rate to adjust the p-values of the individual tests in order to control the probability of making a false positive error.

This is done by setting a threshold for the false discovery rate, such as 0.05, and then adjusting the p-values of the individual tests so that the false discovery rate is less than or equal to the specified threshold. This can help to reduce the number of false positive errors that are made when conducting multiple statistical tests, and can provide more accurate and reliable results.

### 7. Explain with simple example what is poisson distribution?
The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is commonly used to model the number of times that an event occurs within a given time period or area. It is commonly used in fields such as engineering, economics, and biology, and can be used to answer questions about the likelihood of different numbers of events occurring.

For example, suppose that you are interested in the number of people who visit a park on a given day. You know that, on average, 100 people visit the park every day, and you want to know the probability of different numbers of people visiting the park on a particular day. You could use the Poisson distribution to model the number of visitors to the park on a given day.

The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, which is the average number of events that occur within the given time period or area. In this example, the parameter would be 100, because that is the average number of people who visit the park each day.

Using the Poisson distribution, you can then calculate the probability of different numbers of people visiting the park on a given day. For example, the probability of exactly 100 people visiting the park on a given day would be calculated as:

P(X=100) = (e^-100 * 100^100) / 100!

This formula indicates that the probability of exactly 100 people visiting the park on a given day is very small, because the probability of any exact number of events occurring is generally low when using the Poisson distribution. However, you could also use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability of different ranges of numbers of people visiting the park, such as the probability of between 90 and 110 people visiting the park on a given day.

The Poisson distribution is a useful tool for modeling and analyzing the likelihood of different numbers of events occurring within a given time period or area. It can provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends of the events being studied.

### 8. What does it mean "assuming poisson distribution"

When someone says "assuming Poisson distribution," they are referring to the use of the Poisson distribution to model the number of times that an event occurs within a given time period or area. The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is commonly used to model the occurrence of events that happen randomly and independently of each other, such as the number of people who visit a park on a given day or the number of car accidents that occur on a particular stretch of road.

By assuming that the data follows a Poisson distribution, the person is making a statistical assumption that allows them to use the Poisson distribution to model the data and make predictions about the likelihood of different numbers of events occurring. This assumption allows them to use the mathematical properties of the Poisson distribution to calculate probabilities and make inferences about the data.

It's important to note that when someone says "assuming Poisson distribution," they are making a statistical assumption that may or may not be true for the data being studied. In order to determine if the data actually follows a Poisson distribution, you would need to test the data using statistical techniques, such as a goodness-of-fit test. If the data does not follow a Poisson distribution, then the assumptions and inferences made using the Poisson distribution may not be accurate or reliable.

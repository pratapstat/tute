### Understand cellular dynamics

# RNA Velocity

Problem in SC analysis - destructions

Observe cell changes to phenotype

We get only snapshot of the moment - destructive XXX

based on the snapshot reconstruct the dynamics - 

relative information tells us the direction of cellular dynamics.

TF binds to promoter, initiates the gene transcription then unspliced to spliced mRNA to degradation. Intronic reads are captured in 10X sequencing,then by counting the ration of spliced reads with unspliced reads a trajectory is inferred.

Basically, according to RNA velocity, a steadystate should have higher spliced reads than the unspliced reads or highest unspliced reads than splcied reads.

But what if the population does not have steadystate?

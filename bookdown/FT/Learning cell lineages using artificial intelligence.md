Series of snapshots - cellular development - imaging data + genomics + transcriptomics - expression level

Deep learning - layered architects with large scale dataset - computer vision

Stages of cell proliferation - with images - layered architecture and make a predictions - a process is shaped up and finding outliers

Similarly, expressional analysis based on bulk data averages out - cannot get clear picture.

Take transcripts and embed the cells in space - cluster them to cell types - order cells by similarity -  pseudo temporal ordering - cellular differentiation

Which transcripts are playing a role - now how we can perturb the system?

Does stem cell make cells right away? Intestinal stem cells - bridged by progenitor cells - became endocrine cells -

Visually we can see but can test?

Graph abstraction - 

Now we have an Atlas - now let's challenge the system - we see the gut cells before and after.
by knowing what is happening in the healthy and perturbed mouse system by using neural networks we can predict what can happen in perturbed human compared to healthy humans.

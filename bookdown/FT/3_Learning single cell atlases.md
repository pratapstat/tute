Quantifying states of cellular/organ system using scgenomics - make cell atlas for control cases and see how disease situation acts on top of that - then predict state and treatment using AI/ML

**How does cells take a decision?**

The little computers, how do they take signal then decide?
- Survive
- profilerate
- die

Systems biology - bottom up model - attractive but fails when we try to decompose into understandable units and therefore are not fully generalizable.
So, we want to perturb a situation and see how the cells behaves.

A simple model,

Xnew = Xold + Perturbation (p)
